# How it Works

This section explains how Digipairs operates in four main parts: the PINS language, the engine, the factory, and the no-code editor.

## PINS Language

### What is the PINS Language?

The PINS language is a programming language specifically designed for creating and managing artificial intelligence (AI) agents known as Digipairs.

### What is the purpose of the PINS Language?

The PINS language is used to program AI agents, enabling them to perceive their environment, make autonomous decisions, and execute complex tasks. It is the foundation upon which the capabilities of Digipairs are built and extended.

### Strengths of the PINS Language

- **Programmable by AI agents**: PINS is designed to be easily used by AI agents, allowing for efficient and adaptable programming.
- **Controlled context**: The language offers complete control over the context in which agents operate, ensuring precise understanding and management of situations.
- **Limitless scope**: PINS allows for infinite extensibility, providing the ability to develop AI agents with varied and scalable capabilities.

### Mustaches

Mustaches are a syntactic feature of the PINS language that allows for the integration of variables directly into strings. They facilitate the customization and adaptability of scripts by dynamically inserting values at runtime.

#### Example of using mustaches

```pins
{
  "message": "Hello, {{name}}! Welcome to our service."
}
```

In this example, the variable `{{name}}` will be replaced by the actual value of the name at runtime.

### The FEEL Language

FEEL (Friendly Enough Expression Language) is an expression language used in PINS to evaluate conditions, manipulate data, and define complex logic in an intuitive and readable manner.

#### Example of using FEEL

```pins
{
  "condition": "EVALUATE: if (age > 18) then 'adult' else 'minor'"
}
```

In this example, the FEEL expression evaluates whether the age is greater than 18 to determine if the individual is an adult or a minor. The keyword `EVALUATE:` is used to indicate that the FEEL expression should be evaluated.

## Engine

### What is the engine?

The Digipairs engine is an interpreter for the PINS language. It serves as the brain of the Digipairs, enabling the execution of programs written in PINS.

### What is the purpose of the engine?

The engine executes the reasoning and actions defined by the PINS language, allowing Digipairs to operate autonomously and intelligently. It is the central element that transforms programmed instructions into concrete actions.

## Factory

### What is the factory?

The factory is a kind of school for Digipairs, similar to a Pok√©mon version for AI agents. It is the place where Digipairs are trained and configured.

### What is the purpose of the factory?

The factory allows for the training and bringing to life of Digipairs. It provides a controlled environment where agents can learn, be tested, and refined before being deployed in real-world environments.

## No-Code Editor

### What is the no-code editor?

The no-code editor is an intuitive tool that allows users to create and manage Digipairs without needing programming skills.

### Advantages of the no-code editor

- **Easy to use**: The editor's interface is designed to be accessible, even for users without technical experience.
- **No complex knowledge required**: Users can create applications and websites without writing code, making the development process accessible to everyone.
- **Creation and management of Digipairs**: With the no-code editor, users can easily configure, customize, and manage their Digipairs, facilitating the integration of AI into their daily operations.

In summary, Digipairs utilizes a combination of advanced technologies to provide powerful and customizable AI solutions. The PINS language, the engine, the factory, and the no-code editor work together to simplify the creation, training, and management of AI agents, making these technologies accessible and effective for businesses.
