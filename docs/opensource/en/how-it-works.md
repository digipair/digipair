# How It Works

This section explains how Digipairs operates, divided into four main parts: the PINS language, the engine, the factory, and the no-code editor.

## PINS Language

### What is the PINS Language?

The PINS language is a programming language specifically designed for creating and managing artificial intelligence (AI) agents called Digipairs.

### What is the PINS Language Used For?

The PINS language is used to program AI agents, enabling them to perceive their environment, make autonomous decisions, and perform complex tasks. It is the foundation upon which the capabilities of Digipairs are built and extended.

### Key Features of the PINS Language

- **Programmable by AI Agents**: PINS is designed to be easily used by AI agents, allowing for efficient and adaptable programming.
- **Controlled Context**: The language provides complete control over the context in which agents operate, ensuring precise understanding and management of situations.
- **Unlimited Scope**: PINS allows for infinite extensibility, making it possible to develop AI agents with diverse and evolving capabilities.

### Mustaches

Mustaches are a syntactic feature of the PINS language that allows variables to be embedded directly within strings. They facilitate script customization and adaptability by dynamically inserting values at runtime.

#### Example of Mustache Usage

```pins
{
  "message": "Hello, {{name}}! Welcome to our service."
}
```

In this example, the `{{name}}` variable will be replaced by the actual name value at runtime.

### The FEEL Language

FEEL (Friendly Enough Expression Language) is an expression language used in PINS to evaluate conditions, manipulate data, and define complex logic in an intuitive and readable way.

#### Example of FEEL Usage

```pins
{
  "condition": "FEEL: if (age > 18) then 'adult' else 'minor'"
}
```

In this example, the FEEL expression evaluates whether the age is greater than 18 to determine if the individual is an adult or a minor. The `FEEL:` keyword indicates that the FEEL expression should be evaluated.

## Engine

### What is the Engine?

The Digipairs engine is an interpreter for the PINS language. It acts as the brain of the Digipairs, enabling the execution of programs written in PINS.

### What is the Engine Used For?

The engine executes the reasoning and actions defined by the PINS language, allowing Digipairs to operate autonomously and intelligently. It is the central component that transforms programmed instructions into concrete actions.

## Factory

### What is the Factory?

The factory is like a school for Digipairs, similar to a Pokémon version for AI agents. It is the place where Digipairs are trained and configured.

### What is the Factory Used For?

The factory allows for the training and creation of Digipairs. It provides a controlled environment where agents can learn, be tested, and refined before being deployed in real-world environments.

## No-Code Editor

### What is the No-Code Editor?

The no-code editor is an intuitive tool that enables users to create and manage Digipairs without needing any programming skills.

### Advantages of the No-Code Editor

- **Easy to Use**: The editor’s interface is designed to be accessible, even for users without technical experience.
- **No Complex Knowledge Required**: Users can create applications and websites without writing any code, making the development process accessible to everyone.
- **Creation and Management of Digipairs**: With the no-code editor, users can easily configure, customize, and manage their Digipairs, simplifying the integration of AI into their daily operations.

In summary, Digipairs leverages a combination of advanced technologies to provide powerful and customizable AI solutions. The PINS language, engine, factory, and no-code editor work together to simplify the creation, training, and management of AI agents, making these technologies accessible and effective for businesses.
